# Python Programming

This repository contains my learning journey in Python programming. In this repository, I have organized the topics into folders based on their categories to make it easier to navigate.

## Table of Contents

- [Python Modules](#python-modules)
- [Basic Programming](#basic-programming)
- [Object-oriented programming](#object-oriented-programming)
- [Data Structure](#data-structure)
- [Algorithms](#algorithms)

## Python Modules

In this folder, I have covered some of the essential Python modules that are commonly used in data science and machine learning. The modules that I have included are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

## Basic Programming

This folder contains the fundamentals of Python programming. It includes basic syntax, data types, data structures, and string manipulation. The topics covered in this folder are:

- Basic Programming
- Basic List
- Advance List
- Basic Tuple
- List vs Tuple
- Basic String
- Advance String
- String Manipulation
- Basic Dictionary
- Basic Set
- Advance Set
- Collection Module
- Collection

## Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is an essential programming paradigm that is widely used in Python. This folder covers the basics of OOP, including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

## URI Problem Solve

This folder contains solutions to problems from [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br), a website that hosts programming contests and problems. The solutions are written in Python and cover various topics such as data structures, algorithms, and mathematical problems. My URI account link is [here](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/profile/800882), where you can see my submissions and progress.
