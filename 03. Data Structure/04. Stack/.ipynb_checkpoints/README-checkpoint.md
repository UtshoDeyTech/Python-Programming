# Stack Implementation in Array and Linked List

## Introduction

Stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. In other words, the element that is inserted last is the first one to be removed. 

There are two common ways to implement a stack: using an array or a linked list. In this project, we will discuss both implementations, their advantages, and disadvantages.

## Stack in Array

In the array implementation, a stack can be created by using an array and a top pointer. The top pointer always points to the last element in the stack.

Advantages:
- Easy to implement
- Random access of elements
- No memory overhead of pointers
- Cache friendly

Disadvantages:
- Fixed size
- Inefficient if the stack is almost full

## Stack in Linked List

In the linked list implementation, a stack can be created by using a linked list and a top pointer. The top pointer always points to the head of the linked list.

Advantages:
- Dynamic size
- Efficient memory usage
- No overflow problem

Disadvantages:
- Overhead of pointers
- Extra memory for pointers
- Traversing elements is slower

## Conclusion

Both implementations have their own advantages and disadvantages. In general, the array implementation is faster, but it has a fixed size, which can be a disadvantage in some cases. The linked list implementation, on the other hand, is slower but it has a dynamic size, which can be useful in situations where the size of the stack is not known in advance.

In practice, the choice of implementation depends on the specific requirements of the application. If the size of the stack is known in advance and fast access to elements is required, the array implementation may be a good choice. If the size of the stack is not known in advance or memory usage is a concern, the linked list implementation may be a better option.
