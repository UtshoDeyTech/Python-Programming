| **Indexing**             | O(1)                     | O(n)                     |
| **Insert/Delete at Start**| O(n)                     | O(1)                     |

**Explanation:**

- **Indexing:** Arrays use indexes to access elements directly, making it very fast (O(1)). Linked lists need to traverse pointers until they find the element, taking longer on average (O(n)).

- **Inserting/Deleting at Start:** Arrays require shifting all elements, making it slow (O(n)). Linked lists only need to update pointers, making it fast (O(1)).

- **Inserting/Deleting at End:** Arrays can be fast if extra space is available, but resizing can be slow. Linked lists are fast for adding (O(1)) but slower for deleting (O(n)) due to traversal.

- **Inserting in Middle:** Both require shifting elements in the array or traversing pointers in the linked list, making them both O(n).

- **Dynamic Size:** Arrays have a fixed size, while linked lists can grow or shrink as needed.

| **Why to Use**            | - When the order of processing matters and the last item added should be processed first. | - When tasks need to be processed in the order they are received, like in printing jobs or processing requests. |
|                           | - When you need to maintain a temporary history or track the state of a process. | - When a first-come-first-serve order is essential, such as in task scheduling. |

**Explanation:**

- **Operation Principle:** Stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, while Queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

- **Insert (Push)/Remove (Pop):** Both stacks and queues have constant time complexity (O(1)) for insertion and removal operations.

- **Use Cases:** Stacks are commonly used in managing function calls, undo mechanisms, and expression evaluation. Queues are often used in task scheduling, print job queues, and breadth-first search algorithms.

- **Where to Use:** Use a stack when you need to manage function calls in recursion, handle undo/redo functionality, or evaluate expressions. Use a queue when tasks need to be processed in the order they are received, such as in task scheduling or print job queues.

- **Why to Use:** Stacks are useful when the order of processing matters, and the last item added should be processed first. Queues are suitable when a first-come-first-serve order is essential, like in task scheduling.

- **Implementation:** Both stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, depending on the specific requirements of the application.
