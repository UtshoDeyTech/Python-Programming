# Queue in Array and Queue in LinkedList

## Queue in Array

A queue implemented using an array is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It works like a real-life queue or line, where the first person to join the line is the first one to get out.

### When to Use

An array-based queue is a good choice when the size of the queue is known in advance and does not change frequently. It is also an efficient option when the number of items in the queue is relatively small and the queue is not expected to grow too large.

### Advantages

- Fast access to the front and rear of the queue.
- Simple implementation.
- Efficient use of memory.

### Disadvantages

- Limited capacity.
- Resizing the array is expensive.
- Items cannot be easily removed from the middle of the queue.

## Queue in LinkedList

A queue implemented using a linked list is also a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It uses pointers to connect the nodes of the linked list.

### When to Use

A linked list-based queue is a good choice when the size of the queue is not known in advance, or when the size of the queue is expected to change frequently. It is also a good choice when the queue is expected to grow very large.

### Advantages

- Dynamic size.
- Efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- Memory-efficient when the queue is small.

### Disadvantages

- Access to the front and rear of the queue is slower compared to an array-based queue.
- Uses more memory compared to an array-based queue when the queue is large.
- Implementation is more complex.

In general, the choice of which type of queue to use depends on the specific requirements of the application. If memory usage is a concern and the size of the queue is known in advance, an array-based queue may be the best choice. If the size of the queue is expected to change frequently or is unknown, a linked list-based queue may be a better option.

It is important to note that both types of queues can be implemented efficiently and effectively depending on the specific use case and requirements of the application.
