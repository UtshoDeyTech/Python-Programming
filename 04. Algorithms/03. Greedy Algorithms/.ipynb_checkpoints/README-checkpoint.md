# Greedy Algorithm:

**A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result.**

**The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is wrong. It works in a top-down approach.**

**This algorithm may not produce the best result for all the problems. It's because it always goes for the local best choice to produce the global best result.**

**However, we can determine if the algorithm can be used with any problem if the problem has the following properties:**

1. **Greedy Choice Property:** 
If an optimal solution to the problem can be found by choosing the best choice at each step without reconsidering the previous steps once chosen, the problem can be solved using a greedy approach. This property is called greedy choice property.

2. **Optimal Substructure:** 
If the optimal overall solution to the problem corresponds to the optimal solution to its subproblems, then the problem can be solved using a greedy approach. This property is called optimal substructure.

## Advantages of Greedy Approach
* The algorithm is easier to describe.

* This algorithm can perform better than other algorithms (but, not in all cases).
