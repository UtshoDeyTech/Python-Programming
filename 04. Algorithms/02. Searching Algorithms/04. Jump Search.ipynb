    "# Jump Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Like Binary Search, Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.\n",
    "For example, suppose we have an array `arr[]` of size n and a block (to be jumped) of `size m`. Then we search in the indexes `arr[0]`, `arr[m]`, `arr[2m]`…..`arr[km]` and so on. Once we find the interval `(arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m])`, we perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element `x`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let’s consider the following array: `(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610)`. The length of the array is `16`. The Jump search will find the value of `55` with the following steps assuming that the block size to be jumped is `4`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jump from index 0 to index 4; \n",
    "2. Jump from index 4 to index 8; \n",
    "3. Jump from index 8 to index 12; \n",
    "4. Since the element at index 12 is greater than 55, we will jump back a step to come to index 8. \n",
    "5. Perform a linear search from index 8 to get the element 55.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The increasing order of performance is:**\n",
    "`linear search  <  jump search  <  binary search < Ternary search`"

So, in a system where binary search is costly, we use Jump Search.\n"
